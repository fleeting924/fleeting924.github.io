Museo De La Salle is a distinct, multidisciplinary, cultural institution that acts as the De La Salle University System's permanent museum. It commits itself to the collection of collectible items of intrinsic worth important to the preservation of specific facets of the Philippine ilustrado lifestyle, serving as a resource center for both indoor and outdoor collections.

Our section was tasked to create a 3D render of the museum. And for this task, I was assigned to the layout and creating the hallway using Maya.
