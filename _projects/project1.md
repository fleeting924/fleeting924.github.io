Bocchi the Glock is an unofficial fangame featuring the characters from the anime “Bocchi the Rock”. The gameplay is heavily inspired by Vampire Survivors and HoloCure – Save the Fans!. Players must help Bocchi and her friends survive against the relentless waves of “party people”, a symbolic representation of the inner struggles she faces due to her social anxiety, by utilizing unique weapons, items, and abilities that are inspired and themed from the anime.
