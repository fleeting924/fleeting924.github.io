A motivated and curious computer science student who has a passion for technology and innovation. Eager to apply theoretical knowledge gained from coursework to real-world projects and contribute innovative solutions.


## Background

I'm a 3rd year computer science student from De La Salle University - Dasmarinas. In my 3 years of studies, I have developed familiarity in computer science fundamentals, including programming languages such as Java, JavaScript and Python. During this period, I also have gained some experience in database management, algorithm design, and software development methodologies. Furthermore, I have completed courseworks from MOOCs to build on my knowledge.

Outside of that, I'm probably playing video games(DOTA, CS2, OW2, etc.), drawing, or learning new stuffs.
